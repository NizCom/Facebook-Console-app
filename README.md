C++ Object-Oriented Project: 
This project simulates the essential functionalities of a simplified Facebook-like platform. 
Created during my early college studies as I was just starting out with programming, it allowed me to explore the basics of C++ and object-oriented design. 
The project includes features like user creation, sending friend requests, posting updates, and more. 
It represents my initial learning experience in applying object-oriented principles to build a basic social networking simulation. 
I'm eager to learn and improve, so feel free to review the code and share any feedback!
